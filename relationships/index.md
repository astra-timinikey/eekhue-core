# ü™û Relationship ‚Äì The Mirror Work

> ‚ÄúEverything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.‚Äù ‚Äì Carl Jung  

Every relationship is a **living classroom of the Shadow**.  
In others, we see what we cannot see in ourselves ‚Äî sometimes painfully, sometimes beautifully.  

- With partners, sparks of love often hide sparks of projection.  
- With friends, loyalty and conflict reveal hidden expectations.  
- In families, patterns repeat across generations.  
- In teams, trust and tension expose unseen dynamics.  

To grow, we must face what‚Äôs reflected back to us.

## Why Relationships?
Unlike solo growth, relationships **accelerate shadow work** because:  
- They expose blindspots faster than we notice alone.  
- They test whether our growth is real or just theory.  
- They invite us into **shared transformation**, not just individual change.

## A Living Experiment
This Relationship work is not therapy, nor a certified counselling program.  
It is a **theoretical framework in progress** ‚Äî blending Jungian shadow concepts with my own synthesis.  


‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  
- This is **not peer-reviewed research**.  
- It is **not a clinical intervention**.  
- It is a space for **exploration, reflection, and dialogue**.

## Call for Volunteers ‚ú®
To refine this framework, I am inviting:  

- **Pairs** ‚Üí Life partners, business partners, close friends.  
- **Families** ‚Üí Parent‚Äìchild, siblings, or multi-generational groups.  
- **Teams** ‚Üí Workgroups or communities exploring trust & conflict.  

You are welcome to **apply as a pair or group**.  
Solo volunteers may be accepted, but priority is given to shared participation.  

---

## How It Works
1. **Sign up as a volunteer** (form below).  
2. **Choose your context** (partner, family, friends, or team).  
3. **Receive exercises & prompts** designed to spark reflection.  
4. **Share feedback** ‚Äî what landed, what resisted, what surprised you.  

This is a **co-learning journey**.  
By joining, you don‚Äôt just explore your own relationships ‚Äî you help shape a framework for others.
