# ⛵ RE:route – The Ship of Many

> “The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.” – Carl Jung  

RE:route imagines relationships as a great ship carrying multitudes.  
Onboard are companions, rivals, mentors, strangers — each encounter a wave, a storm, or a guiding star.  

- Some passengers stay for the whole journey.  
- Some appear only for a fleeting moment.  
- Some offer encouragement, others bring conflict.  
- All bring opportunities: a test, a trigger, a reminder, a chance to grow.  

Every relationship is part of a **cognitive dance**: patterns of projection, resonance, and reaction.

## Why Relationships?  

Unlike solitary growth, relationships are accelerators:  

- They expose what we cannot see in ourselves.  
- They test whether our growth is embodied or just theory.  
- They provide **knowledge transfer** — wisdom passed between people.  
- They remind us we are never sailing alone.  

In Jungian terms, relationships are fertile grounds for individuation, often surfacing the Shadow and activating archetypal dynamics.

## A Living Voyage  

RE:route is not therapy. It is not a clinical model.  
It is a **navigational framework** — a way of mapping the complex seas of human bonds through Jungian and archetypal lenses.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
- This is **not peer-reviewed research**.  
- It is **not a substitute for counselling or therapy**.  
- It is a space for **reflection, exploration, and shared dialogue**.

## Call for Volunteers ✨  

To refine this voyage, I am inviting:  

- **Pairs** → Life partners, business partners, or close friends.  
- **Families** → Parent–child, siblings, or multi-generational groups.  
- **Teams** → Workgroups, guilds, or communities navigating trust & tension.  

Solo voyagers may be accepted, but priority is given to pairs or groups.  

---

## How It Works  

1. **Sign up as a volunteer** (form below).  
2. **Choose your context** (partner, family, friends, or team).  
3. **Receive exercises & prompts** designed to spark reflection.  
4. **Share feedback** — what connected, what resisted, what surprised you.  

This is a **co-learning journey**.  
By joining, you don’t just explore your own relationships — you help shape a map for others.
