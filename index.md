# ❓ The Questions We Ask

- Why does our inner world feel as infinite as the universe itself?  
- What hidden forces shape the Self, the Persona, and the Shadow?  
- How do we navigate these realms to grow and connect?  


## 💡 The Idea

This platform is a framework for exploring the vast universe within each of us.  
What feels small — the inner world — reveals itself as infinite and complex when explored deeply.  

Psychology meets play: archetypes, functions, and growth become an interactive, gamified adventure.  
Inspired by the works of Carl Jung, John Beebe, and Dario Nardi, it transforms exploration of Self, Persona, Shadow, Growth, and Relationships into a journey you can experience.
