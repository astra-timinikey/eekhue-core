# 🌱 Growth – Becoming Whole

Growth is rarely explosive.  
It is the quiet push of a root through stone.  
The slow unfurling of a leaf toward the light.  
The patience of becoming — unseen, but unstoppable.  

Carl Jung described growth as a lifelong process of *individuation*:  
- **Integrating the Persona** → Loosening the mask, allowing authenticity.  
- **Assimilating the Shadow** → Befriending what we once denied.  
- **Encountering the Anima/Animus** → Reconciling the inner Other, finding balance.  

Growth is not a single leap but a rhythm:  
plant, tend, harvest, compost, repeat.

## 🎮 Growth Garden Game

A small seed represents the start of your journey.  
Every time you return, reflect, or “water” the plant, it grows.  

<div class="growth-garden">
  <h2>🌱 Your Growth Plant</h2>
  <div class="plant-stage" id="plant-stage">
    <p>Stage 1: Seed</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/plant-seed.png" alt="Seed stage">
  </div>

  <button id="water-btn">💧 Water Plant</button>
</div>

<script>
  let stage = 0;
  const stages = [
    { text: "Stage 1: Seed", img: "/assets/img/plant-seed.png" },
    { text: "Stage 2: Sprout", img: "/assets/img/plant-sprout.png" },
    { text: "Stage 3: Budding", img: "/assets/img/plant-bud.png" },
    { text: "Stage 4: Bloom", img: "/assets/img/plant-flower.png" },
    { text: "Stage 5: Tree", img: "/assets/img/plant-tree.png" }
  ];

  document.getElementById('water-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (stage < stages.length - 1) {
      stage++;
      const ps = document.getElementById('plant-stage');
      ps.innerHTML = `<p>${stages[stage].text}</p><img src="${stages[stage].img}" alt="${stages[stage].text}">`;
    }
  });
</script>

## 🌿 Three Paths of Growth

### 🌞 Integrating the Persona  
Loosen the armor. Let others see who you are beneath the role.  

### 🌑 Assimilating the Shadow  
Bring the hidden into the light. What you reject holds keys to your growth.  

### 💫 Reconciling the Anima/Animus  
Balance the inner Other — the qualities you long for yet resist.
