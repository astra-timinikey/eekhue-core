# ⚔️ RE:equip – Equipping the Psyche

Individuation is not only inner reflection —  
it is also about **choosing what you carry** into life.  

Carl Jung described individuation as:  
- **Integrating the Persona** → Loosening the mask, allowing authenticity.  
- **Assimilating the Shadow** → Befriending what we once denied.  
- **Encountering the Anima/Animus** → Reconciling the inner Other, finding balance.  

In RE:equip, these appear as the **armor, weapons, and companions** you equip along your journey.

## 🛡️ Persona as Armor & Outfits

The Persona is the clothing of the psyche — armor, uniforms, costumes we wear to face the world.  

- **Armor** protects but weighs heavy.  
- **Outfits** adapt us to roles and situations.  
- **Performance gear** lets us shine but may conceal.  

**Integrating the Persona** means loosening the mask and choosing roles with awareness.

## ⚔️ Shadow as Weapons & Artifacts

The Shadow is what we reject, deny, or suppress.  
In RE:equip, these appear as **weapons, artifacts, or accessories** lying dormant in the arsenal.  

- A sword feared, yet powerful.  
- A cursed relic that tempts.  
- A hidden strength, long forgotten.  

**Assimilating the Shadow** means befriending what once was denied, learning to wield it responsibly.

## 🐉 Anima/Animus as Summons & Companions

The Anima/Animus is the inner Other — bridging qualities we resist yet long for.  
Here it becomes a **summoned ally, mythical creature, or mentor figure**.  

- A guide whose wisdom feels foreign.  
- A creature that challenges and protects.  
- A companion that expands your horizon.  

**Encountering the Anima/Animus** means reconciling with this Other, finding balance in its presence.

## 🎽 The Wardrobe of the Psyche

To RE:equip is to **step into awareness**.  
Every armor piece, weapon, and summon is part of you.  
Equipping is not escape — it is integration.
