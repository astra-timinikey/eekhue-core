# 🛡️ The Persona Layer – *Armor That Adapts*

## Why Persona?
The Persona is armor — the **adaptive shell** we wear to move through the world.  
Carl Jung described it as a necessary interface between our inner Self and society.  
In Shadow-Hunt, Persona is not a false front, but a **tool**: protective gear that allows you to step into different arenas without losing your core.  

Where the Self is rooted and the Shadow is hidden, Persona is **surface-facing** and **dynamic**.  
It’s the first choice-point in the Hunt: *which armor do you equip?*

## Why Seven Roles?
I outline **seven starter Personas**. This is not a peer-reviewed system, but my own working theory, aligned with Jung’s ideas.  

Why seven?  
- **Symbolic resonance**: the rainbow spectrum, seven virtues/vices, seven archetypal quests.  
- **Psychological practicality**: enough variety to explore, not so many that it splinters into endless subtypes.  
- **Social usability**: each Persona feels distinct, yet fluid enough to shift between.

## Disclaimer
This Persona framework is a **personal synthesis**, not an established psychological model.  
It draws inspiration from Jung’s concept of Persona but reframes it as **armor** — protective, adaptable, and chosen.  

Use it playfully, reflectively, and tactically — not as a cage, but as gear for exploration.
